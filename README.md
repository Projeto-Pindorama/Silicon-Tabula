# Silicon Tabula

This repository contains all documentation for Pindorama projects.  

Besides the ``index.html`` and ``style.css``, which are served directly,
everything here is somewhat "raw material" to be processed via [Traité de la
tabula](https://github.com/takusuman/traite-de-la-tabula.git) from Markdown
to, then, be served as HTML.  

## Directory structure

- `docs/`: Contain directories named by each project, these which contain documentation files;
- `files/`: Miscellaneous files for the Silicon Tabula front-end (images and
  styling) and back-end (scripts and programs);
- `index.html`: There you go.

## Chip in!

If you are willing to chip in something related to the documentation, go ahead!  
We are open for pull-requests, as long it's helpful for the project.  
Please, just note that we are using the [Conventional
Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org) specification, so try to keep your
commits under it. `;^)`
